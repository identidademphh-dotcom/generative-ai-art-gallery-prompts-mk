A surreal digital painting of a bioluminescent albino fox with translucent tails and golden eyes, sitting inside a futuristic floating laboratory surrounded by shattered mirrors and holographic glass. Studio shot with 35mm lens, sharp focus on the fox, background blurred. Volumetric lighting mixed with bioluminescent glow and soft spotlight, creating dramatic reflections across the foxâ€™s fur. The environment is closed, simulating sunlight through synthetic skylights. Texture is a mix of smooth, shiny and feathered surfaces, rendered in hyper resolution, 8K quality, with extremely detailed highlights and shadows. Cyberpunk style, cinematic feel, motion blur in floating particles resembling digital data in the air.
